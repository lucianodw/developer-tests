# Developer Tests

A collection of tests that I was asked to complete during front-end developer interviews.  The company who gave me the test will be kept anonymous, but each test should provide enough detail to get a sense of what the task was and the limitations surrounding the test.

### Tests
* Survey Tool - Create a "survey" creation tool using any frame work you would like.
